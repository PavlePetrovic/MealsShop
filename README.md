# Meals Shop :pizza:

MealsShop is an online shop for ordering food

Take a look: [MealsShop site](https://mealsshopproject.netlify.app/)

## General info

The main idea of this project is to practice React and its main concepts. In addition to all features in the project, the main thing was using ContextAPI and its functionalities. Also, I try to implement a custom hook for form validation. The site is connected to the Firebase Realtime Database, something like an API that stores all shop articles and data of the user who wants to order food.
